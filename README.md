# Recommender Systems Tasks Repository

Welcome to my Recommender Systems repository! 🎬  
This repo contains a collection of practical recommender-system experiments and algorithm implementations, structured as self-contained Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb).  

Each notebook includes inline imports, code commentary, and task explanations.  
Notebooks are best viewed after download — preview is disabled due to their size and output content.

## 📑 Task Overview  

| Notebook | Topic | Key Concepts | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------------|-------|
| RecSys1_Intro.ipynb | 🎥 Fundamentals of Recommender Systems | Collaborative Filtering, Jaccard Similarity, Normalized PMI, and Latent Factor Models (SVD) | Implemented base recommender structure and several collaborative filtering variants (user–user, item–item). Explored Jaccard and NPMI similarities, SVD-based latent models. Tasks are inspired by the [Yandex Data School (ШАД) RecSys course](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/recsys_course). The experiments were primarily conducted on IMDb movie data, but the codebase is flexible enough for anime or other domains. |
| RecSys2_CatBoost_LavkaEvents.ipynb | 🛒 Learning to Rank in E-Commerce | Feature Engineering, Train/Validation Splitting without Temporal Leakage, Gradient Boosting (CatBoost), Ranking Metrics (NDCG, Novelty, Serendipity) | Worked with real user interaction logs from the Yandex Lavka app. Built time-aware training sets, engineered behavioral features (CTR, personalized purchase frequency), trained a CatBoost ranking model, and evaluated recommendations using ranking metrics such as NDCG@K, Novelty@K, and Serendipity@K. Demonstrated how relevance and diversity trade-offs influence user experience. |

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation  

To run the notebooks locally, you’ll need Python 3.9+ and the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recsys-tasks.git
cd recsys-tasks
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can open notebooks directly in Google Colab — all imports are provided inline.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook (e.g., `RecSys1_Intro.ipynb`).  
Run the cells sequentially — each notebook contains:

- Task formulation  
- Code implementation  
- Result visualization and commentary

## 📊 Implemented Techniques

This repository currently includes implementations of:

- Jaccard-based Collaborative Filtering (user–user & item–item)  
- NPMI (Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information) for penalizing popularity bias  
- Latent Factor Models (Truncated SVD) for dense representation learning  
- Dataset processing with Polars for fast tabular computation  
- Sparse representation and optimization using SciPy CSR matrices  

---

## 🛠 Dependencies

Main libraries used across notebooks:

- numpy, polars, scipy, tensorflow  
- matplotlib, tqdm, PIL, BeautifulSoup  
- requests, kagglehub, concurrent.futures, tensorboard  

See `requirements.txt` for details.

## 🌟 Future Work

Planned extensions include:

- Implicit feedback matrix factorization (ALS)  
- Hybrid content–collaborative recommenders  
- Evaluation metrics (MAP@K, NDCG, Recall@K)  
- Advanced embeddings (Word2Vec/GraphSAGE-based models)  
- Visualization of latent spaces via TensorBoard Projector
